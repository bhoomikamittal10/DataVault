# DataVault
DataVault is an innovative web-based solution designed to help users capture, store, and access internet sessions for offline use. The goal is to solve everyday connectivity issues such as slow Wi-Fi, unstable networks, and limited data availability by enabling users to “carry” parts of the internet with them—even when offline.
